# SMAloggerAPI
A Java API to read data from SMA devices, based on the SBFspot project

This is a redesigned version of the <a href="https://github.com/Harrum/SMAlogger">SMAlogger project</a> 
which was a direct translation of the <a href="https://sbfspot.codeplex.com/">SBFspot project</a>.

The goal of this project is to transform the original SBFspot program into a more flexible usable API.

# Usage
To use this project you need Java version 8 and a SMA solar inverter, no additionally libraries are needed. 
Use the argument -v[1-5] to set the level of logging and -d[1-5] to set the level of debug information.

Note: Multiple inverters should be supported but I have no way of testing this, so I don't know yet if this 
functionality works.

Major props to the creators of the original SBFspot project.
